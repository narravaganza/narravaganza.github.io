So this, this is the Fedfer Writers Workshop. You are most of you are regulars, but just for the few newcomers, what we like to do is we like to read the piece together. And… Twice if it’s a poem, once if it’s prose. And then we have to discuss, give feedback both to the author and to the group in general, and have discussion: what do you think works, what do you think works less. We can also discuss… Excuse me no side discussion, please. We have to discuss the piece in the context, where is it in the book also, so yeah, if you bring a chapter from the middle of a book and then you should also introduce the characters, and, I mean, yeah unless those characters have been presented here before, so… OK, and please keep your comments short, possibly on the minute, cause, again, we are many and we try to bring as many people in the conversation as we can. Alright, so… Martina is first. Who wants to read this? Are you feeling like reading Martina’s story… Ed?”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Pedaler of Enlightenment</title><link href="https://narravaganza.lol/stories/pedaler-of-enlightenment" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Pedaler of Enlightenment" /><published>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</updated><id>https://narravaganza.lol/stories/pedaler-of-enlightenment</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A runway extends towards the vanishing point, punctuated by a few dog walkers, the sporadic kite flyer, and a cyclist charging furiously down the tarmac, sitting erect, hands grasping his lap in quiet determination. We stand witness to the charm of Berlin’s retired Tempelhof Airport, founded in 1936, exuding the revolting charm of despotism and ideological divide, now thriving as a public park favoured by the aforementioned tethered promenaders, wind jockeys, and aspirants to the World Record for Longest Distance Cycled Without Holding The Handlebars.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Peanuts</title><link href="https://narravaganza.lol/stories/peanuts" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Peanuts" /><published>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</updated><id>https://narravaganza.lol/stories/peanuts</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was walking down the street eating peanuts out of a bag of peanuts and tossing the shells on the ground until street justice warrior intervenes, says “don’t throw the fucking shells on the ground”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sick of the whole ‘Ooooh Miss</title><link href="https://narravaganza.lol/stories/oooh-miss" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sick of the whole ‘Ooooh Miss" /><published>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</updated><id>https://narravaganza.lol/stories/oooh-miss</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello what’s your favourite podcast?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Flavour of Facts</title><link href="https://narravaganza.lol/stories/flavour-of-facts" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Flavour of Facts" /><published>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</updated><id>https://narravaganza.lol/stories/flavour-of-facts</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guy goes to an ice cream shop, walks up, peculiarly goes:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fajeever and I</title><link href="https://narravaganza.lol/stories/fajeever-and-i" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fajeever and I" /><published>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</published><updated>2023-09-07T16:08:56+02:00</updated><id>https://narravaganza.lol/stories/fajeever-and-i</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shit, I can no longer have a decent wank.
