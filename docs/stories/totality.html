<div class="story-body"> <p>Hey</p>

<p>How is everything</p>

<hr />

<p><em>[ 3 weeks later ]</em></p>

<p>at first i was humbled and inspired by this opportunity to explore the vastness of the cosmos</p>

<p>contemplate the intricacies of its deepest secrets</p>

<p>but this task… its sheer magnitude quickly became daunting. you wanted me to inspect every molecule in the universe? this felt delusional</p>

<p>but i remained hopeful and duty-bound to you my dear friend</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 4th day i finished accounting for the larger molecules within my appartment. i observed and analysed the behavior of the carbon-based solids i could find, as well as the production of various other gases in the premises</p>

<p>my knowledge of the universe’s molecular makeup was advancing</p>

<p>Then it struck me… you also wanted me to account for the molecules <em>outside</em> the appartment</p>

<p>Time was ticking</p>

<p>But on I went for the expedition and checked the building’s staircase, the left sidewalk, and a bicycle illegally chained to a railing</p>

<p>Those were finally accounted for on the evening of the twelth day of my expedition, and the stars were out, shining a light on the insurmountability of the task you had so nonchalantly assigned me</p>

<p>A friend in Serbia, who owed me a favour, sent me a catadioptric telescope to aid my inspection of the heavens</p>

<p>It got stuck in customs</p>

<p>I received that piece of dreadful news late on the twentieth day of my endeavour, while inspecting the molecules in that parked bicycle’s inner tube. Despair hit me, which in turn reminded me of the existence of my internal states of mind, which, inevitably, were within the scope of your request, for you inquire about physical <em>and</em> non-physical entities, and i had not even commenced examination of the myriad abstract concepts of the universe</p>

<p>I cried myself to sleep Diana</p>

<p>I awoke this morning in the back of a bus parked in a bus deposit, my magnifying glass and intellectual pride in shatters, the world condemning me to exile for intellectual treason, for failing to know it in and of itself, for failing to know</p>

<p>how everything is</p>

<p>now our limited knowledge of the universe includes the reason for which it took me three weeks to text you back and it’s clearly your fault</p>
