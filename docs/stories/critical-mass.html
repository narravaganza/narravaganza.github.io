Please note that this group should be considered a 'fan site' and involvement in this group, either as a member or admin, should not be construed as being an 'organiser' of Fedfer Critical Mass: there are none.

WHO ARE WE AND WHAT ARE OUR AIMS?
We are not sure, opinions seem to differ. There are probably as many aims of Critical Mass as there are participants. Each individual comes there with his or her own idea of what it's about, and the sum of this makes up the Mass. We have no organisers and no planned routes.

This was my first critical mass and i loved it! such friendly people, funny dresses, and i loved the mobile sound systems, got to bop to some good reggae and disco. i was at the front of the mass for a whole 149 seconds (timed myself lol) and took us down Navona. someone else randomly took over “leadership” after Frano. amazing how a big mass of cyclists can spontaneously thread its way through the city, ive never seen so many cyclists at once. i felt a sense of belonging i’ll be back.</p>

Great vibes, thanks everyone for coming. peace out to everyone. i felt a sense of belonging again, thanks for making it happen. didn’t get to lead this time but i got to be a plug between Quaymole and Colfax, had to hold back two toyotas and an angry cab driver,but I counted about two hundred and fourty cyclists whose path i protected. WE NEED MORE PLUGS!!!! consistently. the mass got broken up a few times when plugs were missing, especially through Rivadavia.</p>

special ride, peace out to everyone, thanks for coming. i want to say that this is beautiful anarchy, in a good sense, it shows that anarchy can work. four hundred people on a bicycle, stranger to each other,  form a swarm that goes unscathed through hostile streets. we don’t agree on a path, let alone a leader, but we agree to cycle together and thereby protect each other. that’s anarchy and IT WORKS…</p>

Good ride people!!! Shout out to the two dogs in the basket!! good to see there were more plugs along Rivadavia and that made us go through it like butter. really enjoyed the disco sound system this time, thanks to the kind lady who brought it.</p>

<p>One thing is that I don’t think that it was necessary for everyone to stop for a punctured tire. I’m sorry that that gentleman had a flat tire, but you gotta realise that it takes upwards of ten minutes to fix that sort of thing and i’ts a bit unfair to the 349 people who attended to effectively PARALYSE the mass so that the kind soul of the hour can go and be a hero. this is not what we’re about at CRITICAL MASS. i mean if i get a flat during critical mass then fine no problem let the mass continue its route, i dont need nor want everybody to stop for me. let’s keep that in mind next time.</p>

Good ride guys, but I don’t think that forcing the entire mass to stop for 30 minutes, just to hang those white bikes, was necessary. Yes I respect the white bikes as a symbol, and I respect your mourning of a fellow cyclist, but imposing that on everyone is authoritarian and against the spirit of what we’re about. I’d like to remind everyone that ANARCHY is the prime objective here, the mass needs to be an embodiment of THE TRIUMPH OF ANARCHY. there were people giving political speeches ffs right after they hung the bike which will probably get stolen before the end of the week. can we please stay free</p>

This felt like being in a tour bus. there was Shorty  giving a speech at the beginning of the ride, and he CLEARLY HAD the itinerary prepared, he and his acolytes rode at the front the entire time and everyone is just blindly following them. when I got to the front and suggested a few directions for the mass but they just ignored me and they led the whole way. Yes, critical mass is being taken for a ride, there are attempts at manipulating everyone here involved into whatever ideology! dont let that happen! we are about efficient triumphant anarchy here!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>i’ll stay on and will protect us from this</p>
