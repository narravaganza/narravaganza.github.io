<div class="story-body"> <p>“Why is there a dead spider on my bed?”</p>

<p>“Baby love what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“Why is there a dead spider on my fucking bed!”</p>

<p>“Baby love”</p>

<p>“MAURICE”</p>

<p>“Baby”</p>

<p>“Maurice, you got here before me, right?”</p>

<p>“Yeah and went out to the shop, we’re out of rubber”</p>

<p>“Maurice, you know I hate spiders”</p>

<p>“Baby listen, let me take a look at it… Where is it? Oh, that. OK. It’s not dead, it’s moving. Oh no, it’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Maurice, you know I hate spiders.”</p>

<p>“Baby listen, just calm down. Your breathing… Here, I’ll just get this tissue, and there we go. And it’s out the window.”</p>

<p>“Maurice, listen, I can’t work here anymore.”</p>

<p>“What? Why not baby?”</p>

<p>“I can’t. Dead spider. Breaks my concentration. My teeth are rattling.”</p>

<p>“Your teeth rattle?”</p>

<p>“IT COMPROMISES BLOWJOBS MAURICE”</p>

<p>“Look, what if you swap rooms with Chrystalia? I’m sure he’ll be ok”</p>

<p>“MAURICE NO! CHRYSTALIA’S ROOM STINKS OF VOMIT”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, baby love, I’m not sure. Definitely not since Monday, we changed cleaners.”</p>

<p>“But can I keep my current bed and saddle?”</p>

<p>“Like, you want to move this bed over to Chrystalia’s room?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure we can, baby love, door frame is too small, we’d have to disassemble it and shit.”</p>

<p>“I’m not using Chrystalia’s bed.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, we can swap mattresses.”</p>

<p>“We’re definitely swapping mattresses.”</p>

<p>“Com’ere baby love”</p>

<p>“Maurice, I’m so scared”</p>

<p>“Baby love it’s alright, it’s just a spider, it’s summer, little insects come out and they’re alive and they want some of your sweet ass, you know?”</p>

<p>“Spiders aren’t insects.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Spiders aren’t insects.”</p>

<p>“Baby, whatever.”</p>

<p>“You’re such an ignorant anus.”</p>

<p>“Yeah baby my ass doesn’t know better.”</p>

<p>“Heee heee.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, made you laugh there, baby love, made you laugh. How was last night?”</p>

<p>“Had seven passes, raked a grand. Joel came.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“He brought a friend.”</p>

<p>“Any latex this time?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t wanna buy our latex pack?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you offer it to him?”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>(slaps Baby Love)</p>

<p>“Baby love, nobody is buying the latex, and you’re not helping”</p>

<p>“They can tell it’s been used, Maurice”</p>

<p>“How the fuck can they tell it’s been used, baby love??”</p>

<p>“They open it and they can see, it feels too sticky.”</p>

<p>(slaps Baby Love)</p>

<p>“Why the fuck you let them open it and shove their dick and hands in it, baby love, for fuck’s sakes. How do you think this business will run. Help me move the mattress. NOW! Pick up that edge. Oh for fuck’s sakes it’s wet! Godmotherfucking damn it, baby love, why don’t use the covers?”</p>

<p>“Chrystalia took them all.”</p>

<p>“Chrystalia’s got two covers on her bed??”</p>

<p>“It’s the showers.”</p>

<p>“OK whatever GRAB THE FUCKING MATTRESS. Good, now rotate… We have to rotate it to get it out the door… No, rotate this way, towards the window. Towards the window!”</p>

<p>(uses mattress to try to push Baby Love out the window)</p>

<p>“Maurice, why are you pushing me!! Maurice, stop! Maurice, don’t push! MAURICE FUCK, DON’T PUSH! HELP!”</p>

<p>“Seriously why don’t you ask that fucking dead spider for help, baby love, I’m so sick and tired of your shit.”</p>

<p>“Maurice don’t push, oh my god, Maurice!”</p>
