# Goals
1. Make you laugh or smile.
1. Try writing in _digital vernacular_ â€“ the writing style that emerged from the Internet.
1. Use various Internet mediums (e.g. social media posts, text messages, emails, etc.) as a literary technique to tell a story. I want to produce beautiful pieces of _digital_ [literary realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism){:target="_blank"}).
1. Avoid traditional publishing, which restricts readership to a tiny percentage of the world population willing to pay for the work. Whereas by publishing on a website this work is freely available to everyone. 
1. Make available all previous editions of the texts through this repository's git history.
