# Goals
1. Make you laugh or smile.
1. Write stories in _digital vernacular_ â€“- the writing style that emerged from the Internet.
1. Use various Internet mediums (e.g. social media posts, text messages, emails, etc.) as a literary technique to tell a story.

Basically, I want to produce beautiful pieces of [digital literary realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism){:target="_blank"}).

# Some writing that inspired me
