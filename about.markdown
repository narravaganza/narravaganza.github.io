preview: A collection of funny short stories written in digital vernacular, the writing style of the Internet. 
---

# Goals
1. Make you laugh or smile.
1. Try writing in _digital vernacular_ â€“ the writing style that emerged from the Internet.
1. Use various Internet mediums (e.g. social media posts, text messages, emails, etc.) as a literary technique to tell a story. I want to produce beautiful pieces of _digital_ [literary realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism){:target="_blank"}).
1. Avoid traditional publishing, which restricts readership to a tiny percentage of the world population willing to pay for the work. Whereas by publishing it on this website, this work is freely available to everyone.
1. Make available all previous editions of the texts through this repository's git history.
