# About

Narravaganza is an online collection of humorous short stories and flash fiction. The stories here range from misadventures in a spiritual radio station to hilarious interpretations of classic jokes. Punchy and concise narratives to address some needs of the digital age.

# Goals
1. Make you laugh or smile.
1. Try writing in _digital vernacular_ â€“ the writing style that emerged from the Internet.
1. Use various Internet mediums (e.g. social media posts, text messages, emails, etc.) as a literary technique to tell a story. I want to produce beautiful pieces of _digital_ [literary realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism){:target="_blank"}).
1. Avoid traditional publishing, which restricts readership to a tiny percentage of the world population willing to pay for the work. Whereas on this website, it is freely available to everyone.
1. Make available all previous editions of the texts through this repository's git history.
