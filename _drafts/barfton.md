No it's not going great right now, I just flew back from London, had a bit of a rough time there, sorting out paperwork related to the flat, sleeping like shit, haven't had more than 4 hours of sleep in the past 5 days, but oh man I gotta tell you a story though, gotta tell you a story here. 

Basically the first four days i was there just sorting out the flat, and i've been talking to helen, don't know if i mentioned her, basically old fling from like six years ago, lives in liverpool, and we said, she'd come down to london and we'd book a hotel and spend the last night together. 

i mean i like her, she's a sensitive, clever girl, not very talkative, tall and the face of a fairy, she looks like a fairy, pale face, tiny deep blue eyes, long dark curly hair, silent but will sometimes instead of saying yes, she will close her eyes and smile and shake her head, and you can like hear faint tinkling cause she, she looks like a fairy. floats from place to place. 

i went to pick her up at the station, looked up which platform her train would arrive at so that i could be romantically posing at the end the platform, and she'd slowly and sensually walk towards me, but ten minutes after the train arrived she just showed up from behind me cause she's a fairy and floats her way around. 

we walked from euston to camden, we had booked a nice restaurant three days in advance, because eagerness and shit. Vegan place, lots of nice warm big chunky and creamy veg. Crap service, the waitress spilt water on our table when she was pouring it to us, i thought that was the end of the world. Paid bill, not cheap, and headed to... Our hotel. 

shit this audio is already taking up 10 minutes but thanks for sitting through it. Got to the hotel. Which wasn't exactly a hotel, it had guest house in the name, and in fact it looked more like a house than a hotel. i swear the second i saw the hotel i told helen "this place is haunted" and she laughed in a sweet way like heee heee maybeeee

we had to walk up stairs to get there, massive door at the top, we ring the bell, we're let in by this guy in shorts, and there's just a narrow hallway inside. We walk up
