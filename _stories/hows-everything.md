Hey
You ok?
How's everything

***

*[ 5 days later ]*

at first i was humbled and inspired by the opportunity to explore the vastness of the cosmos

contemplate the intricacies of its deepest secrets

the task... its sheer magnitude is daunting. you wanted me to inspect every molecule in the universe? this felt delusional 

but i remained hopeful and duty-bound to my dear friend

On Sunday afternoon i was able to account for the larger molecules within my appartment. i observed and analysed the behavior of the carbon-based solids i could find, as well as the production of various other gases in the premises

my knowledge of the universe's molecular makeup was advancing

Then it struck me… you also wanted me to account for the molecules _outside_ the appartment

Time was ticking

But on I went for the expedition and checked the building’s staircase, the left sidewalk, and a bicycle illegally chained to the railing

Those were ok too, but by then it was Tuesday afternoon and the stars were out, shining a light on the insurmountability of the task you had so nonchalantly assigned me

A friend in Serbia, who owed me a favour, sent me a catadioptric telescope to aid my inspection of the heavens

It got stuck in customs

I received that piece of dreadful news late on Wednesday evening while inspecting the molecules in that parked bicycle’s inner tube. Despair hit me, which in turn reminded me of the existence of my internal states of mind, which inevitably were within the scope of your request, for you inquire about physical and non-physical entities, and i had even commenced examination of the myriad abstract concepts of the universe

I cried myself to sleep Diana

I awoke this morning in the back of a bus parked in a bus deposit, my magnifying glass and intellectual pride in shatters, the world condemning me to exile for intellectual treason, for failing to know it in and of itself, for failing to know 

how everything is
